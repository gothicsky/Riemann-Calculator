# Riemann-Calculator
im noob so not user friendly at all <br>
very simple script that can get the riemann sum of basic functions <br>
you add the function you want in the math libraries format as an input <br>
first enter your outer function then enter the value you want to enter inside it between '!'  <br>
example: sin!2*x! <br>
example: !x**2!  <br>
example: exp!(x*2)+3! <br>
