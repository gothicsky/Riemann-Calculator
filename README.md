# Riemann-Calculator
im noob so not user friendly at all
very simple script that can get the riemann sum of basic functions
you add the function you want in the math libraries format as an input
first enter your outer function then enter the value you want to enter inside it between '!'
example: sin!2x! 
example: !x**2! 
example: exp!(x*2)+3!
